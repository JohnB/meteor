Dynamically tell time. 
First we create the "clock" metor app


This creates a directory that looks like this:


In the client dir, create an app.js file with these pieces:
A route, to let meteor know that the root of your clock app should show the clock.html template (we'll get to that later).

A helper that can be referenced from the clock.html template 

And a timer function that sets the "currentTime" field of the Session pbject:



Finally, the clock.html file looks like this, with just a reference to the Session data 

And that is all there is to it! You can fire up the server with
And view it in your browser

Footnote: the use of a helper isnt strictly necessary - we could have referenced the session data directly from the clock.html template - but the helper lets us change our implementation without changing all the view code that depends on it - which seems like a good practice to me.
